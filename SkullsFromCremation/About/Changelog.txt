Version 1.2.5 (August 15th 2021)

* Fixed 'Failed to find Verse.ThingCategoryDef named Corpse_Human. There are <x> defs of this type loaded.' error.
	* At least, I think I did; I don't get it on startup anymore.
	* Thanks to blargsnarf from Reddit for bringing this error to my attention.
	* I suggest that you check your bills to make sure the option on whether or not to use colonist corpses is set to your own preference.
* If you use the Fertile Fields mod, you should now get a skull when you turn corpses into compost.
	* Thanks to Grumbaki from Reddit for suggesting that I patch this in.
* It is no longer possible to acquire skulls from headless corpses.
	* Use of this mod now requires that you have the '[1001]Filter by Headless' mod installed. (It is not required to load this mod after that one.)

Version 1.1.3 (August 13th 2021)

* Changed name of mod (yet again) to Simple Skulls (was Easier Skull Gathering).
	* Thanks to Jiopaba from the RimWorld Discord for the suggestion.

Version 1.1.2 (August 12th 2021)

* In response to feedback I got on Reddit, a new recipe has been added which will give the skull from butchered humanoids.
	* Available at both the butcher's table and the butcher's spot.
* Changed name of mod to Easier Skull Gathering (was Skulls from Cremation).

Version 1.0.1 (August 12th 2021)

* Initial release.
