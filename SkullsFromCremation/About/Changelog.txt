Version 1.8.8 (January 23rd 2023)

* Mod is now compatible with the RimWorld 1.4 patch.
* Honest Corpse: Recipes added by this mod are now patched to require corpses with heads by default. If you want to disable this, follow the instructions in the description on the Steam Workshop.

Version 1.8.6 (April 3rd 2022)

* Added six new patches which will be applied if Honest Corpse is enabled.
	* Acquire 1 skull while liquifying corpses.
	* Acquire 1 skull while extracting iron from corpses.
	* Acquire 3 skulls while acidifying corpses.
	* I also included patches which changed these recipes to no longer allow the use of headless corpses, but I commented them out so they wouldn't be applied (since you'd have to dispose of headless corpses another way). If you want to use these patches, feel free to edit the patch file. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found in the description on the Steam Workshop.
* The patch for Fertile Fields now properly checks to see if that mod is enabled.

Version 1.2.5 (August 15th 2021)

* Fixed 'Failed to find Verse.ThingCategoryDef named Corpse_Human. There are <x> defs of this type loaded.' error.
	* At least, I think I did; I don't get it on startup anymore.
	* Thanks to blargsnarf from Reddit for bringing this error to my attention.
	* I suggest that you check your bills to make sure the option on whether or not to use colonist corpses is set to your own preference.
* If you use the Fertile Fields mod, you should now get a skull when you turn corpses into compost.
	* Thanks to Grumbaki from Reddit for suggesting that I patch this in.
* It is no longer possible to acquire skulls from headless corpses.
	* Use of this mod now requires that you have the '[1001]Filter by Headless' mod installed. (It is not required to load this mod after that one.)

Version 1.1.3 (August 13th 2021)

* Changed name of mod (yet again) to Simple Skulls (was Easier Skull Gathering).
	* Thanks to Jiopaba from the RimWorld Discord for the suggestion.

Version 1.1.2 (August 12th 2021)

* In response to feedback I got on Reddit, a new recipe has been added which will give the skull from butchered humanoids.
	* Available at both the butcher's table and the butcher's spot.
* Changed name of mod to Easier Skull Gathering (was Skulls from Cremation).

Version 1.0.1 (August 12th 2021)

* Initial release.
